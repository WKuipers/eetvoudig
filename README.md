# eetvoudig

This side project of [eetFestijn](joostrijneveld/eetFestijn) makes it easy to organise a shared meal for a group that uses a Wiebetaaltwat list. It allows for users outside the group as well, but requires them to pay via one of the group members.

This project is a testing ground for a feasibility of proper Wiebetaaltwat intergration. At some point parts of this functionality might be merged into eetFestijn.
